ver 1.0.68:
  add check to return value of function

ver 1.0.67:
  add several double check to invalid or null value

ver 1.0.66:
  fix h263 encoder failure issue due to invalid frame rate

ver 1.0.65:
  fix vpu hange issue caused by non-supported vc1 clip

ver 1.0.64:
  fix some potential issues, include memory leak and uninitialized variable

ver 1.0.63:
  fix special clips in which there are two different SPS headers before the first frame

ver 1.0.62:
  add check for invalid frame rate

ver 1.0.61:
  enable resolution change report for vp8 and H.263

ver 1.0.60:
  fix the inaccurate crop info for vp8

ver 1.0.59:
  handle the special gop size in order to pass some CTS tests in which large gopsize will be set
  
ver 1.0.58:
  fix one potential risk where encoder may crash at close stage in multi-instance case
  
ver 1.0.57:
  fix bug for clips with resolution change in which one internal variable need to be cleared.

ver 1.0.56:
  re-enable detection of resolution change due to the latest FW

ver 1.0.55:
  fix bug for resolution change in loop play
  add workaround for rmvb decode timeout issue when no enough frame buffer

ver 1.0.54:
  revert detection of resolution change(bit20) since vpu may report resolution change wrong for corrupted clips.

ver 1.0.53:
  add detecting of resoluton change(bit20)
  fix bug of eos condition in multi-instance
  
ver 1.0.52:
  For corrupted clips with only one frame, we will report error instead of eos
  
ver 1.0.51:
  modify the checking of return value from IOGetVirtMem

ver 1.0.50:
  add support for nal_size_length is equal to 1 or 2
  fix bug in detecting of illegal memory access
  fix bug related with conflict buffer state

ver 1.0.49:
  add config for intra refresh mode
  enhance avcc conversion for corrupted clips
  change deblock related parameter to improve encode quality
  config stuff padding(disable) for mjpeg encoder

ver 1.0.48:
  enhace the robust in avcc conversion operation for corrupted clips
  add api to query the available frame buffer number in decoder
  code refine, fix some typo error

ver 1.0.47:
  add one workaround to fix AVC decoder no frame issue

ver 1.0.46:
  add debug code to detect illegal memory access

ver 1.0.45:
  add avcc format for H.264 decoder

ver 1.0.44:
  add avcc format for H.264 encoder

ver 1.0.43:
  add workaround to fix vp8 buffer conflict issue: buffer is decoded repeatedly

ver 1.0.42:
  add workaround to fix VC1 decode failure issue: flush before the first frame is decoded

ver 1.0.41:
  enhance encoder part: add qp related configuration
